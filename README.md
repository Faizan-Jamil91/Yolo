YOLOv5 Real-Time Object Detection
This is a real-time object detection application using the YOLOv5 deep learning model, implemented with Streamlit. The app detects objects from a webcam feed and provides visual and audio feedback for the detected objects.

Features:
Real-time Object Detection: The app uses YOLOv5 to detect objects in the video feed from your webcam.
Audio Feedback: The detected objects are announced audibly using the pyttsx3 text-to-speech engine.
Interactive Interface: Use the "Start" button to begin the detection and the "Stop" button to end the session.
Live Video Stream: The webcam feed is displayed in real-time, with bounding boxes around detected objects.
Prerequisites:
Before running the app, ensure that you have the following installed:

Python 3.6 or higher
streamlit (for creating the web app)
torch (for loading the YOLOv5 model)
opencv-python (for video capture)
pyttsx3 (for text-to-speech)
Installation:
Clone the repository or download the files to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies by running:
bash
Copy code
pip install streamlit torch opencv-python pyttsx3
Usage:
Start the app:
Open the terminal and navigate to the directory containing the app script (e.g., realtime_yolov5_app.py).
Run the following command:
bash
Copy code
streamlit run realtime_yolov5_app.py
Access the app:
The app will open in your default web browser automatically.
If it doesn't, navigate to the URL shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:8501).
Interact with the app:
Click the Start button to begin real-time object detection using your webcam.
The app will detect and display objects in real-time, along with a text-to-speech announcement.
Click the Stop button to stop the webcam feed and object detection.
How It Works:
The app uses YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art object detection model, to process frames from the webcam in real time.
It identifies objects, draws bounding boxes around them, and labels them.
The pyttsx3 library is used to audibly announce the detected objects.
Troubleshooting:
If the app doesn't display the webcam feed, ensure that your webcam is correctly connected and that you've granted permission to access the webcam.
If the app is running in a cloud or remote environment, webcam access may not be available.
